        <h2 id="contributions">Who Was Brahmagupta?</h2>
        <p>Brahmagupta was a 7th-century Indian mathematician and astronomer who made several groundbreaking contributions to mathematics and astronomy. Known as one of the most important mathematicians of ancient India, Brahmagupta's work laid the foundation for key mathematical concepts that would shape the development of algebra, number theory, and geometry.</p>

        <h2>Major Mathematical Contributions</h2>
        <p>Brahmagupta's contributions span multiple areas of mathematics. His work is still relevant today, particularly in the fields of algebra and number theory. Here are some of his most notable achievements:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="highlight">Zero and Negative Numbers</span>: Brahmagupta was the first to provide systematic rules for dealing with zero and negative numbers. He explained how to add, subtract, multiply, and divide using these concepts, which was revolutionary at the time.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Algebra</span>: Brahmagupta made significant advancements in algebra by providing solutions to linear and quadratic equations. His approach to solving equations was an early step toward the development of modern algebra.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Geometry</span>: Brahmagupta made advances in geometry, particularly in the area of cyclic quadrilaterals (four-sided figures inscribed in a circle). He derived a formula for calculating the area of such quadrilaterals, which is still used today.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Astronomy</span>: Brahmagupta also contributed to astronomy, particularly in his work on planetary motion and the calculation of the positions of celestial bodies. He described the motions of planets and stars, integrating mathematical principles with astronomical observations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Impact and Legacy</h2>
        <p>Brahmagupta's work had a profound influence on the development of mathematics and astronomy. His treatises were studied by later mathematicians in India, and his ideas spread to the Islamic world through Arabic translations. His work on zero, negative numbers, and algebra formed the foundation for much of the mathematics that we use today.</p>
        <p>His mathematical rules for zero, negative numbers, and quadratic equations paved the way for future advancements in algebra and number theory, which influenced mathematicians like Al-Khwarizmi and European scholars during the Renaissance.</p>
